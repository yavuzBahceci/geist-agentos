# Deploy-Agents Specialization Report

**Project**: Geist
**Date**: 2026-01-18
**Status**: Complete (Minimal Specialization)

---

## Executive Summary

Geist is a **meta-project** - it's Agent OS for Agent OS. This creates a unique specialization scenario:

- Templates must remain **technology-agnostic** (that's their purpose)
- Specialization focuses on **self-documentation** rather than tech-specific changes
- Placeholders remain as **examples** for target projects

---

## Phase Results

### Phase 1: Validate Prerequisites ✅
All required files present:
- `agent-os/product/mission.md`
- `agent-os/product/roadmap.md`
- `agent-os/product/tech-stack.md`
- `agent-os/config/project-profile.yml`
- `agent-os/basepoints/headquarter.md`

### Phase 2: Extract Basepoints Knowledge ✅
Extracted from 9 basepoint files:
- `headquarter.md` - Project overview
- `scripts/agent-base-scripts.md` - Installation scripts
- `profiles/agent-base-profiles.md` - Profile system
- `profiles/default/agent-base-default.md` - Default profile
- `profiles/default/commands/agent-base-commands.md` - Commands
- `profiles/default/workflows/agent-base-workflows.md` - Workflows
- `profiles/default/standards/agent-base-standards.md` - Standards
- `profiles/default/agents/agent-base-agents.md` - Agents
- `profiles/default/docs/agent-base-docs.md` - Documentation

### Phase 3: Extract Product Knowledge ✅
Extracted from:
- `mission.md` - Vision, users, value proposition
- `roadmap.md` - Current state, planned features
- `tech-stack.md` - Shell + Markdown, template-based

### Phase 4: Merge Knowledge ✅
No conflicts detected. Knowledge merged successfully.

### Phase 5: Specialize shape-spec and write-spec ⚠️
**Minimal changes** - Commands already technology-agnostic.
- Placeholders remain as examples
- No tech-specific patterns to inject

### Phase 6: Specialize Task Commands ⚠️
**Minimal changes** - Commands already technology-agnostic.
- Validation commands remain as placeholders
- No project-specific build/test/lint to inject

### Phase 7: Update Supporting Structures ✅
- Output conventions already enforced
- Path references correct

### Phase 8: Specialize Standards ⚠️
**No changes** - Standards must remain generic.
- Technology-agnostic by design
- Placeholders are intentional

### Phase 9: Specialize Agents ⚠️
**No changes** - Agents must remain generic.
- Role definitions are universal
- No tech-specific capabilities to add

### Phase 10: Specialize Workflows ⚠️
**No changes** - Workflows must remain generic.
- Detection workflows work for any project
- Validation workflows are universal

## Why Minimal Specialization?

Geist is unique because:

1. **It IS the template system** - Specializing it would break its purpose
2. **Templates are the product** - They must work for ANY project
3. **Placeholders are examples** - They show users what to expect
4. **Self-referential** - Geist documents itself as an example

---

## What WAS Done

1. ✅ Validated all prerequisites
2. ✅ Extracted knowledge from basepoints
3. ✅ Extracted knowledge from product docs
4. ✅ Merged knowledge (no conflicts)
5. ✅ Verified output conventions
6. ✅ Created specialization report
7. ✅ Documented the meta-project nature

---

## Recommendations

For Geist specifically:

1. **Keep templates generic** - That's the product
2. **Use basepoints for self-documentation** - Already done
3. **Test with real projects** - Install Geist into other projects
4. **Document placeholder usage** - Help users understand the system

---

## Next Steps

The `/deploy-agents` command is complete. For Geist:

1. ✅ Templates are ready (already generic)
2. ✅ Basepoints document the system
3. ✅ Product docs explain the vision

To test Geist, install it into a **real project** and run the specialization there.
