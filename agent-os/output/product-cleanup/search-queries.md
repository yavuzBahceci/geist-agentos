## Notes

This project is a meta-tool (Agent OS for Agent OS), so many of the patterns are self-referential. The primary enhancement opportunity is in:

1. **Shell script robustness** - The installation scripts could benefit from better error handling
2. **Template syntax documentation** - The `{{}}` syntax could be better documented
3. **Prompt engineering patterns** - Since this generates AI prompts, prompt engineering best practices are highly relevant
