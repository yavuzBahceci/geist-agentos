# Geist - Product Mission

## Vision

Geist is a universal Agent OS that makes AI coding assistants project-aware. It extends the original Agent OS concept to work with any project type—not just full-stack web apps—by automatically detecting tech stacks, documenting codebase patterns, and specializing AI commands to match how developers actually build.

## Core Problem

AI coding assistants lack project context. They generate generic code that doesn't match your patterns, conventions, or architecture. The original Agent OS solved this for web development but assumed a specific project structure.

**The gap**: Developers working on mobile apps, CLI tools, embedded systems, or non-standard architectures couldn't benefit from structured AI workflows.

## Solution

Geist provides:

1. **Project-Agnostic Templates** - Abstract command templates that work for any project type
2. **Automatic Detection** - Detects tech stack, build commands, and architecture from config files
3. **Codebase Documentation** - Creates "basepoints" that capture your patterns per module
4. **Command Specialization** - Transforms generic templates into project-specific commands
5. **Product-Focused Cleanup** - Removes irrelevant content and expands relevant patterns based on detected scope

## Target Users

| User Type | Need |
|-----------|------|
| **Solo developers** | Consistent AI assistance across projects |
| **Teams** | Shared patterns and conventions for AI workflows |
| **Non-web developers** | Agent OS benefits for mobile, CLI, embedded projects |
| **AI-first developers** | Structured spec-driven development workflow |

## Core Value Proposition

> "Agent OS that works for YOUR project, not just web apps."

- **Universal**: Works with any tech stack (Node.js, Rust, Python, Go, etc.)
- **Automatic**: Detects project characteristics instead of asking questions
- **Specialized**: Commands understand your codebase patterns
- **Structured**: Spec-driven workflow from requirements to implementation

## Key Differentiators from Original Agent OS

| Aspect | Original Agent OS | Geist |
|--------|-------------------|-------|
| Project types | Full-stack web only | Any project type |
| Setup | Manual questionnaire | Auto-detection |
| Tech detection | Manual | Automatic from config files |
| Patterns | Manual documentation | Auto-generated basepoints |
| Validation | Basic | Uses your actual build/test/lint |

## Success Metrics

1. **Adoption**: Projects using Geist across different tech stacks
2. **Time savings**: Reduced setup time vs manual configuration
3. **Quality**: AI output matches project patterns
4. **Coverage**: Support for major tech stacks and project types

## Non-Goals

- Not a framework or runtime
- Not a code execution engine
- Not a replacement for developer judgment
- Not magic—still requires human review
