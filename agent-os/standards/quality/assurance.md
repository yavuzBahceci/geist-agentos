## Quality assurance best practices

- **Quality Gates**: Establish quality gates that must be passed before code is merged or deployed
- **Code Quality Metrics**: Track code quality metrics (complexity, maintainability, test coverage) to identify areas for improvement
- **Static Analysis**: Use static analysis tools to catch potential issues before runtime
- **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor performance characteristics and set performance budgets or targets
- **Security Review**: Conduct security reviews for features that handle sensitive data or user input
- **Accessibility Standards**: Ensure software is accessible to users with disabilities (where applicable to the project type)
- **Usability Testing**: Test user-facing features for usability and user experience quality

## Quality Metrics

- **Code Complexity**: Monitor and manage code complexity to maintain maintainability
- **Test Coverage**: Track test coverage for critical paths and business logic
- **Bug Tracking**: Track and analyze bugs to identify patterns and areas for improvement
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Establish and monitor performance benchmarks for critical operations

## Quality Processes

- **Code Review**: Use code review as a quality gate to catch issues before they reach production
- **Automated Checks**: Automate quality checks (linting, formatting, tests) to ensure consistency
- **Quality Audits**: Conduct periodic quality audits to assess overall codebase health
- **Continuous Improvement**: Continuously refine quality processes based on lessons learned

## Quality Standards

- **Maintainability**: Write code that is easy to understand, modify, and extend
- **Reliability**: Build systems that handle errors gracefully and recover from failures
- **Performance**: Design systems to meet performance requirements and scale appropriately
- **Security**: Follow security best practices to protect user data and system integrity
