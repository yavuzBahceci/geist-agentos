## Development workflow best practices

- **Feature Development Process**: Follow a consistent process for developing features: understand requirements, design approach, implement, test, review, and deploy
- **Incremental Development**: Build features incrementally, delivering working functionality at each step rather than big-bang implementations
- **Code Review Process**: Establish clear code review practices including what to review, review timing, and feedback mechanisms
- **Branching Strategy**: Use a consistent branching strategy that supports parallel development while maintaining code quality
- **Commit Practices**: Write clear, descriptive commit messages that explain what changed and why
- **Integration Points**: Identify and test integration points early to catch issues before they compound
- **Refactoring Strategy**: Refactor continuously as part of feature development, not as separate tasks
- **Technical Debt Management**: Track and address technical debt proactively rather than letting it accumulate

## Collaboration Practices

- **Communication**: Maintain clear communication channels for discussing technical decisions and blockers
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Document decisions and share knowledge to prevent silos
- **Pair Programming**: Use pair programming or code review for complex or critical changes
- **Mentoring**: Support knowledge transfer between team members of different experience levels

## Planning and Estimation

- **Task Breakdown**: Break large features into smaller, manageable tasks
- **Estimation**: Use consistent estimation techniques that account for complexity and uncertainty
- **Risk Assessment**: Identify and plan for technical risks early in the development process
- **Scope Management**: Clearly define what's in scope and out of scope for each feature or iteration
