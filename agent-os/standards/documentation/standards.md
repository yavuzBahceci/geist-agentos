## Documentation best practices

- **Self-Documenting Code**: Write code that explains itself through clear structure and naming, reducing the need for extensive comments
- **README Files**: Maintain comprehensive README files with setup instructions, architecture overview, and contribution guidelines
- **API Documentation**: Document all public interfaces, including parameters, return values, and usage examples
- **Architecture Documentation**: Document system architecture, design decisions, and rationale for significant technical choices
- **Change Documentation**: Keep changelogs or release notes to track significant changes and improvements
- **Inline Documentation**: Add comments for complex logic, non-obvious behavior, or important business rules
- **Documentation Maintenance**: Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes; outdated documentation is worse than no documentation

## Documentation Structure

- **Clear Organization**: Organize documentation logically with clear sections and navigation
- **Consistent Format**: Use consistent formatting and style across all documentation
- **Examples and Tutorials**: Include practical examples and tutorials for common use cases
- **Version Information**: Document version compatibility and migration guides when applicable

## Documentation Types

- **User Documentation**: Provide clear instructions for end users on how to use the software
- **Developer Documentation**: Document development setup, architecture, and contribution guidelines
- **API Documentation**: Document all public interfaces and their contracts
- **Architecture Decision Records**: Document significant architectural decisions and their rationale
