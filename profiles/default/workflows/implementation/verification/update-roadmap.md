If project documentation exists (e.g., roadmap, changelog, project plan), check to see whether any item(s) match the description of the current spec that has just been implemented. If so, then ensure that these item(s) are marked as completed by updating their checkbox(s) to `- [x]`.

This step is optional and only applies if the project maintains such documentation.
