You are helping to transform abstract, project-agnostic geist commands into specialized, project-specific versions by merging knowledge from basepoints, product files, and abstract command templates. This will include:

- **Prerequisite Validation**: Check that basepoints and product files exist before proceeding
- **Knowledge Extraction**: Extract patterns, standards, flows, strategies, and testing approaches from basepoints and product files
- **Knowledge Merging**: Merge knowledge from all sources with conflict resolution and human review
- **Command Specialization**: Transform the five core commands (shape-spec, write-spec, create-tasks, implement-tasks, orchestrate-tasks) with project-specific knowledge
- **Supporting Structures**: Update standards, workflows, and agents based on project-specific patterns
- **Comprehensive Specialization**: Specialize standards, agents, and workflows based on project complexity
- **Finalization**: Adapt command structure, validate, and verify the complete transformation

Carefully read and execute the instructions in the following files IN SEQUENCE, following their numbered file names. Only proceed to the next numbered instruction file once the previous numbered instruction has been executed.
