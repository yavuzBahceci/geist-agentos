You are helping to specialize the installed Geist for this specific project by extracting knowledge from basepoints and product files, then applying that knowledge to standards and agents.

This process will:

- **Prerequisite Validation**: Check that basepoints and product files exist
- **Knowledge Extraction**: Extract patterns, standards, flows, strategies from basepoints and product files
- **Knowledge Merging**: Merge knowledge from all sources with conflict resolution
- **Standards Specialization**: Update standards with project-specific patterns and conventions
- **Agents Specialization**: Create specialist agents based on project's abstraction layers
- **Navigation**: Summary and next steps
