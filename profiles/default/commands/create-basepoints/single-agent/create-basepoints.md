You are helping me analyze an existing codebase and generate comprehensive basepoint documentation. The following MULTI-PHASE process will analyze the codebase, detect abstraction layers, and create basepoint files for each module and parent folder, extracting patterns, standards, flows, strategies, and testing approaches at every abstraction layer.

Carefully read and execute the instructions in the following files IN SEQUENCE, following their numbered file names. Only proceed to the next numbered instruction file once the previous numbered instruction has been executed.

Instructions to follow in sequence:

{{PHASE 1: @agent-os/commands/create-basepoints/1-validate-prerequisites.md}}

{{PHASE 2: @agent-os/commands/create-basepoints/2-detect-abstraction-layers.md}}

{{PHASE 3: @agent-os/commands/create-basepoints/3-mirror-project-structure.md}}

{{PHASE 4: @agent-os/commands/create-basepoints/4-analyze-codebase.md}}

{{PHASE 5: @agent-os/commands/create-basepoints/5-generate-module-basepoints.md}}

{{PHASE 6: @agent-os/commands/create-basepoints/6-generate-parent-basepoints.md}}

{{PHASE 7: @agent-os/commands/create-basepoints/7-generate-headquarter.md}}

{{PHASE 8: @agent-os/commands/create-basepoints/8-generate-library-basepoints.md}}
