You are helping to clean up and fix issues in an already-deployed agent-os instance. This includes:

- **Validation**: Run comprehensive validation to identify issues (placeholders, unnecessary logic, broken references)
- **Knowledge Verification**: Verify that sufficient knowledge has been extracted and no important information is missing
- **Placeholder Cleaning**: Replace remaining placeholders with project-specific content
- **Unnecessary Logic Removal**: Remove project-agnostic conditionals, generic examples, and profiles/default references
- **Broken Reference Fixing**: Fix broken command cycle references and align commands with current project structure
- **Reporting**: Generate comprehensive cleanup report showing what was fixed
