Now that you've initialized the folder for this new spec, proceed with the research phase.

## Step 1: Extract Basepoints Knowledge (if basepoints exist)

Before researching requirements, extract relevant basepoints knowledge to inform the research process:

```bash
# Check if basepoints exist
if [ -d "agent-os/basepoints" ] && [ -f "agent-os/basepoints/headquarter.md" ]; then
    # Determine spec path
    SPEC_PATH="agent-os/specs/[current-spec]"
    
    # Extract basepoints knowledge using scope detection
    {{workflows/basepoints/extract-basepoints-knowledge-automatic}}
    {{workflows/scope-detection/detect-abstraction-layer}}
    {{workflows/scope-detection/detect-scope-semantic-analysis}}
    {{workflows/scope-detection/detect-scope-keyword-matching}}
    
    # Load extracted knowledge for use in research
    if [ -f "$SPEC_PATH/implementation/cache/basepoints-knowledge.md" ]; then
        EXTRACTED_KNOWLEDGE=$(cat "$SPEC_PATH/implementation/cache/basepoints-knowledge.md")
    fi
    
    # Load detected layer
    if [ -f "$SPEC_PATH/implementation/cache/detected-layer.txt" ]; then
        DETECTED_LAYER=$(cat "$SPEC_PATH/implementation/cache/detected-layer.txt")
    fi
fi
```

If basepoints exist, the extracted knowledge will be used to:
- Inform clarifying questions with existing patterns
- Suggest reusable patterns and modules for the detected abstraction layer
- Reference historical decisions and pros/cons
- Present common/reusable patterns to avoid unnecessary work

## Step 2: Research Spec Requirements

Follow these instructions for researching this spec's requirements:

{{workflows/specification/research-spec}}

## Display intermediate confirmation

Once you've completed your research and documented it, proceed to validation:

## Step 3: Run Validation

Before completing, run validation to ensure outputs are correct:

```bash
SPEC_PATH="agent-os/specs/[current-spec]"
COMMAND="shape-spec"
{{workflows/validation/validate-output-exists}}
{{workflows/validation/validate-knowledge-integration}}
{{workflows/validation/generate-validation-report}}
```

## Step 4: Generate Resource Checklist

Generate a checklist of all resources consulted:

```bash
{{workflows/basepoints/organize-and-cache-basepoints-knowledge}}
```

After all steps complete, inform the user:

```
Spec initialized successfully!

✅ Spec folder created: `[spec-path]`
✅ Requirements gathered
✅ Basepoints knowledge extracted: [Yes / No basepoints found]
✅ Detected layer: [LAYER or unknown]
✅ Visual assets: [Found X files / No files provided]
✅ Validation: [PASSED / WARNINGS]

👉 Run `/write-spec` to create the spec.md document.
