You are helping to adapt an existing codebase into product documentation by analyzing the codebase and gathering product information from multiple sources.  This will include:

- **Setup and Information Gathering**: Create inheritance folder, check existing product folder, gather information from user, documents, links, web search (optional), and codebase traversal
- **Codebase Analysis**: Analyze existing codebase structure, dependencies, documentation, and code organization
- **Mission Document**: Take all gathered information and create a concise mission document
- **Roadmap**: Create a phased development plan with prioritized features
- **Tech stack**: Establish the technical stack used for all aspects of this product's codebase
- **Review and Combine**: Analyze all product documents together, verify consistency, and create summary
- **Product-Focused Cleanup**: Simplify and enhance geist files based on detected product scope
- **Navigate to Next**: Provide summary of accomplishments and guide to next command
